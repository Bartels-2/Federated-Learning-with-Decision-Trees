# Reducing communication and computation cost by generating datasets from decision trees in a federated learning environment

This is the Git-Hub repository for our paper "Reducing communication and computation cost by generating datasets from decision trees in a federated learning environment"

The repository contains the following elements:

1. The implementation of our methods for two different datasets + a Fed-AVG algorithm which is used as comparison
2. The environment details that are contained in the .venv file
3. The datasets
4. A pdf of our research paper
